** Checks (Thomas)

Check if the functionality works in all these cases with
nonstandard names for censoring and competing risks

 - with competing risks and censoring
 - without competing risks
 - without censoring
 - without competing risks and without censoring

** Output (Puriya)


Improve summary and plot functions

** Flaskehalse i stor data (Hannah)

- remove long and list of wide data

** Positivity (Kathrine)

** Long to Wide for start stop variables (Christian)

- discretization of register data 
- examples of non-chronical variables
- effect of different interval lengths on wide format (used drug x% of the time) 


* Do this soon
** Check if outcome is constant before running anything
** allow subsets to define Strata as a vector of values (requires that the variable is in the prepare_data) 
* Related literature (check these out)
** Trimming (instead of g-bounds) time dependent? diaz + post-doc
** SATE survivor average treatment effect
* Describe extensions
* Find alternative estimators and corresponding R-packages
* Pooled logistic regression for g-part (censoring/propensity)
** How to set up the data: multiple lines per subject?
** How to summarize the history: for sum(bar L) the range of the variable increases with time
** What is the correct loss function? patients should be similar wrt outcome risk not propensity!?
* Import various Hely-programs
