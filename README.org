* rtmle

This is the development version of the R-package =rtmle=. The package
implements algorithms for causal inference with event time
outcomes. Compared with it's predecessor =ltmle= (thank you Joshua
Schwab!) it has a different user interface for the longitudinal
targeted minimum loss-based estimator. The user initializes an object
and then step-by-step prepares the analysis by adding protocols of the
emulated target trial, data, and modelling instructions to the
object. This process is fully pipeable since version 2025.06.25.
