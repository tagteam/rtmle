#' @description 
#' splitSeq is a function which can split records according to a vector of
#' selected times.  At the outset each record has two variables representing
#' start and end on a time scale. A vector of time points is supplied and each
#' record is replaced by as many records as the number of times points from the
#' vector that occurs in the interval.  After splitting the variable
#' representing end of time is replaced by the splitting-time and the next
#' record has this splitting-time as the start of time variable.
#' 
#' This function is particularly useful to split variables according to 
#' variables that change continuously. Typical situations are age(e.g. 5 year
#' periods), calender time (e.g. 2 year periods) and selected times after a
#' situation of interest (e.g. fixed sized time periods after a starting date). 
#' The input is a data.table and splitting guide.  The "base" data are the 
#' data to be split. They may contain much information, but the key is "id",
#' "start" and "end". These describe the participant's id, start of time 
#' period and end of time period.
#' 
#' The other input is data to define splitvector and name. The splitvector may
#' be a fixed vector (format="vector", e.g. a series of fixed calender dates) or 
#' a list of 3 integers defining start, end and interval to split by 
#' (format="seq", for a split on age between 20 and 80 by 5 years a splitvector 
#' could be defined as: 
#' splitvector <- c(20,80,5)*365.25 and provided to the function as a variable).
#' "varname" is a name of a variable in the data.table the defines a value to be
#' added to the splitvector.  For the age split just used as an example it would
#' be a variable containing the birth date. For a split after onset of a
#' conditi on it should be the date of the condition and NA when the condition 
#' does not occur.  When no value should be added to the vector (e.g. split by 
#' calender time) "varname" should keep its default value of NULL.
#' 
#' On output a new variable with default name "value" defines the result of 
#' splitting. The variable can be renamed to a user defined name (e.g.
#' value="myvalue"). This variable will contain zero when time is before the
#' first value of the splitting vector (added the "varname") and then increased
#' by one as each value of the splitting vector is reached.

#' @usage
#' splitSeq(indat,invars,varname=NULL,splitvector,format,value="value",
#' datacheck=TRUE)
#' @author Christian Torp-Pedersen
#' @param indat base data with id, start, end and other data - possibly 
#' already split
#' @param invars column names for id,entry,exit - in that 
#' order, example: c("id","start","end")
#' @param varname name of variable to be added to vector
#' @param splitvector A vector of calender times (integer). Splitvector is
#' a sequence of fixed dates (or other time scala).
#' @param format String with two possible values:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{"vector"} a series of fixed calender dates
#' \item \code{"seq"} see description
#' }
#' @param value 0 to the left of the vector, increase of 1 as each element of 
#' vector is passed
#' @param datacheck - Checks that data are in appropriate format and that 
#' intervals are neihter negative or overlapping. Can be set to FALSE if checked
#' elsewhere.
#' @return
#' The function returns a new data table where records have been split according 
#' to the values in splitvector. Variables unrelated to the splitting are left 
#' unchanged.
#' @export
#' @details 
#' The input must be data.table.  This data.table is assumed already to be split 
#' by other functions with multiple records having identical participant id. 
#' The function extracts those variables necessary for splitting, splits
#' by the provided vector and finally merges other variable onto the final 
#' result.
#' 
#' A note of caution: This function works with dates as integers. R has a de-
#' fault origina of dates as 1 January 1970, but other programs have different
#' default origins - and this includes SAS and Excell. It is therefor important
#' for decent results that care is taken that all dates are defined similarly.
#' 
#' The output will always have the "next" period starting on the day where the
#' last period ended. This is to ensure that period lengths are calculated pro-
#' perly. The program will also allow periods of zero lengths which is a conse-
#' quence when multiple splits are made on the same day. When there is an event
#' on a period with zero length it is important to keep that period not to 
#' loose events for calculations. Whether other zero length records should be
#' kept in calculations depend on context.
#' 
#' This function is identical to the lexisSeq function with the change that 
#' "event" is not considered.
